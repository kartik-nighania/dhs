Why are you here today?\\n#Person2#: I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.\\n#Person1#: Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.\\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\\n#Person2#: Ok.\\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\\n#Person2#: Yes.\\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.\\n#Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.\",\n",
